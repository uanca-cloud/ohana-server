Effective Date: July 1, 2022

This Privacy Notice will provide you with information on the data privacy practices of Voalte, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Baxter International Inc., and its global affiliates (collectively, “Voalte,” “we,” or “us”), related to the personal information we receive about you through your use of the Voalte Family Application (“Voalte Family App”). This Privacy Notice applies to your use of the Voalte Family App, which is an application that permits a healthcare provider (“Medical Professional”) to share information about a patient’s (“Patient") treatment and health status with the Patient’s identified family member, friend, or caregiver (“Primary Family Member”). The Primary Family Member can subsequently add other family members who are involved in the Patient’s care (“Other Family Members”) to the Voalte Family App so that the Other Family Members also can have access to information that the healthcare provider shares about the Patient through the Voalte Family App.  The Primary Family Member and Other Family Members are collectively referred to in this Agreement as “Family Members” or “you”.

This Privacy Notice applies to your use of the Voalte Family App, whether you are the Primary Family Member or Other Family Member, and provides you with information on how we will use and disclose your personal data that we collect about you as a user of the Voalte Family App and how you can exercise rights regarding your personal data.


What personal data we collect

We collect your first name, last name, phone number, your relationship to the Patient, and your preferred language to register you for the Voalte Family App to permit the Patient’s healthcare provider to communicate information and updates about the Patient with you, the Primary Family Member and/or Other Family Member.  As part of the registration process, you will also need to enter the Patient’s date of birth as part of the process to confirm that you are authorized to obtain access to the Patient’s information.

How long we keep your personal data

Your personal data will be retained for no longer than 365 days as determined by the health care provider’s facility.

Do not track
