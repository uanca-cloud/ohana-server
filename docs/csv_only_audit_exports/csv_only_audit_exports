# CSV only audit exports

This document should track server specific changes required to implement csv only audit export feature in Voalte Family application.

### Overview

The reason behind adding this feature to the Voalte Family application is to allow Admins to download audit CSV's without having to also
download all the media associated with the given timeframe.

### Configurations

No configuration changes

### Implementation

-   The `CreateAuditReportInput` type on the schema should be updated to contain the new flag `includeMedia` used for filtering media in or out. The new property should be versioned, and only available for clients with version greater or equal to 1.9.0:

    ```
      input CreateAuditReportInput {
        # ISO-8601 compliant date
        startDate: String!
        
        # ISO-8601 compliant date
        endDate: String!
        includeMedia: Boolean @version(version: "1.9.0")
    }
    ```

-   To allow the `@version` directive work on an input field the @version directive will need to be updated to include `INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION`:

    ```
        directive @version(version : String) on FIELD_DEFINITION | INPUT_FIELD_DEFINITION
    ```

-   In `CreateAuditReportSchemaValidation.js`
    - Add new field to validate of type boolean for `includeMedia`

-   In `CreateAuditReportResolver.js`
    - Accept new property `includeMedia` from args.input
        - If `version` is less than 1.9.0 default this to true
    - Pass `includeMedia` to `replaceAuditReport`
    - Pass `includeMedia` to `createAuditEventReport`

-   In `AuditEventsReportsDao.js`
    - Accept `includeMedia` from `auditInfo`
    - Update the report name to have `audit_log_media` instead of `audit_log` if `includeMedai` is true
    - Pass `includeMedia` to `createAuditEventReport`

-   In `AuditFunction.js`
    - Accept the new property `includeMedia` from `myQueueItem`
    - Update logic to skip uploading photoAttachments if `includeMedia` is true
        - The specific logic for uploading/looping photos should be refactored to be more clear
